### Project Description
According to the USDA, the U.S. Food Imports dataset provides an annual summary of the value and volume of food and beverage imports into the United States. It reflects U.S. consumer preferences for diverse, high-quality, and convenient foods, driven by increasing wealth, ethnic diversity, and demand for tropical and gourmet products. The dataset includes import values by food group, origin, and HS (Harmonized System) codes, with over 20 years of data for tracking long-term trends. Data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.
The columns in the data set represent product categories, import volume, country identifiers, and financial metrics such as inflation. The data types present in the set include both categorical values and numerical values. The dataset is well-rounded, providing a diverse set of attributes that allow for a comprehensive analysis of international food imports. 
We chose to utilize this dataset because of its relevance to understanding economic and supply chain trends, particularly in the current global landscape where food security and international trade are relevant issues. Therefore, insights about this topic are both socially and economically significant for everyone.

### Data Manipulation
In order to prepare the data for analysis, we created relationships between relevant tables for each of our questions.  Before using tableau to visualize the data it was necessary to condense the data since the set was so expansive. We did this by getting rid of redundant data in the excel pivot tables.

### Question 1: What have been the key trends in United States food import values over the past 5 years, and do the trends differ between food types?
Relevance: The purpose of this question is to illustrate shifts in consumer demand since 2019. By analyzing trends across different food types, it reveals patterns in market dynamics, such as increasing reliance on certain products. It also shows which countries have the strongest trade relationships with the United States in regards to certain food.

#### Grains

Over the past five years, the United States has experienced a steady increase in grain imports, with 2022 showing the most significant year-over-year growth. This surge was primarily driven by imports from Canada, which saw a more than 25% increase compared to 2021. The data highlights the U.S.'s heavy reliance on North American countries, particularly Canada and Mexico, for its grain supply, underscoring the importance of regional trade partnerships in meeting domestic demand.

#### Meats

Over the past five years the US has experienced a bell curve in the amount of meats imported, with 2022 yielding higher meat imports than 2023. We see the expected high amounts of trade with North American countries, but there exists an unexpected amount of imports from Oceanic countries such as Australia and New Zealand. 

#### Dairy

Over the past five years the US has experienced a massive increase in the amount of dairy imported, with there being an over 40% increase in importation since 2020. While there is no standout country that trade these goods to us (Italy lands the top spot), a diverse array of countries engage in this trade unlike the other two products. 


#### Question 1 Conclusion
Over the past five years, U.S. imports of grains, meats, and dairy have demonstrated distinct patterns shaped by varying global and domestic factors. Grain imports have shown consistent growth, with 2022 standing out as the year of the largest surge due to a 25% increase in imports from Canada, underscoring the U.S.'s reliance on its North American trade partners for agricultural staples. Meat imports, however, have been more volatile, peaking in 2022 before declining in 2023, likely influenced by inflationary pressures and shifting consumer preferences. Interestingly, imports from Oceanic countries like Australia and New Zealand have played a more significant role in the meat trade, contrasting with the predominantly North American focus of grain imports. Dairy imports tell a different story, with an impressive 40% growth since 2020, driven by increasing demand for diverse products and a broader array of trading partners. Unlike grains and meats, dairy imports are less concentrated, with Italy as a top supplier and significant contributions from various other countries, reflecting the U.S.’s appetite for specialty and high-quality dairy products.

### Question 2: Which foods suffered the most from price inflation in 2023? Are they the same foods that experienced inflation in 2022?
Relevance: This question addresses the economic impact of price inflation on U.S. food imports, providing insights into how market conditions, supply chain disruptions, and trade policies may have affected food prices in the past few years. By identifying the foods that fluctuate in price, consumers can better understand the volatility in the food market and its implications for food accessibility.

#### Findings

In 2023, the highest inflation rates were observed in Cocoa and Chocolate, Dairy, and Sugar and Candy. In contrast, foods like Nuts, Vegetable Oils, and Meats, which faced the highest inflation in 2022, saw significant deflation in 2023, suggesting improved market conditions. The shift in inflationary trends highlights the dynamic nature of food import markets, where certain categories recover while others face new challenges. 

#### Question 2 Conclusion
The high inflation rates across most food categories in 2022 can possibly be attributed to the lingering effects of the global pandemic, which disrupted supply chains and increased production costs. By 2023, the market appears to have adjusted, with many categories, such as Vegetable Oils and Fish and Shellfish, seeing price reductions. Notably, the graph and table for 2022 shows no price reductions at all. The information presented in these models show that the market for certain foods have definitely improved in the past year, although the decrease in inflation may not be enough to compensate for the increases in previous years. 

### Project Summary
The significance of the analysis of the U.S food import data over the last five years shows insights into the broader economic realm of food trade with market dynamics and consumer demand. With the inclusion of the unique trends from grains, meat, and dairy, and the values from economic impact of price inflation, the crucial data entails the shifts in consumer demand and the effects of possible economic decisions of made in response to global agriculture trends and pressure. For consumers the data gave insights on anticipating price changes and making informed dietary choices. For corporations and policymakers, provide a structure/ basis for trade agreements and  supply chain strategies to help with current and future U.S food security and economic objectives.
